"""TTS Backend Adapters for Open Unified TTS.

These adapters integrate popular TTS backends with the unified API.
Each adapter implements the TTSBackend interface.

Included adapters:
- OpenAudio (Fish Speech) - Voice cloning, ~5GB VRAM
- VoxCPM - High-quality character cloning via Gradio, ~18GB VRAM
- VoxCPM 1.5 - Higher quality cloning via OpenAI API, ~8GB VRAM, 44.1kHz
- Kyutai (Moshi) - Emotional TTS presets, ~4GB VRAM
- Higgs - Generative voice creation from descriptions, ~15GB VRAM
- VibeVoice - Real-time streaming TTS, ~2GB VRAM
- ElevenLabs - Cloud TTS fallback, no GPU required

To add your own adapter:
1. Create a class inheriting from TTSBackend
2. Implement: name, port, vram_gb, is_available(), generate()
3. Add to the router in router.py
